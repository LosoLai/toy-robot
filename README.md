# Toy Robot Simulator

The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square table top,
of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes. 
There are two ways for running the ToyRobotApplication:

## 1. Execute the runnable JAR file in command prompt
### Prerequisites
Install Java on your computer if it isn't installed. You can't run JAR files without Java installed on your computer. If you don't already have Java installed, go to Java's website at https://www.java.com/en/download/ and click the Free Java Download button below the latest version of Java, then install Java once it downloads.
You may have to restart your computer for Java to be fully implemented.

In terms of the application is command line based program, therefore it required few more steps to run it in command prompt.

Step1: 
Open command prompt, and please make sure the working directory is directed to as same as the file path.
For example: the Demo.jar placed in desktop, the path should be : C:\Users\<User Name>\Desktop;
then in the command prompt should use "cd C:\Users\<User Name>\Desktop" to direct to the same directory

Step2:
Typing "java -jar Demo.jar" to execute the JAR file

Then the program will run directly by displaying the instructions to guide you put commands for testing.
